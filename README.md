# intel8080-simulator-in-java
this is an intel 8080 simulator written in java. it takes assembly language code from a txt file and simulates the process of execution. displaying the data in the registers and in the memory during runtime.
the project is madeup of two classes for now 
the register class wich holds the register and memory next
the PIEASM class wich does the actual simulation. it makes a two parse on the source assembly code and executes line by line.
